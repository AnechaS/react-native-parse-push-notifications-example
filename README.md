# MusicList2

A revamped MusicList repo that includes commits for every single tutorial

To see the code in the exact state in which it should be at the end of any tutorial, simply follow these steps:
 1. Clone this repo into a clean directory
 2. Find the tutorial code you want to view in the [commit list](https://github.com/CloseBrace/MusicList/commits/master). eg: "Tutorial #24" would have the code as it should be at the *end* of Tutorial 24
 3. Click the clipboard icon to get the full SHA value for the commit
 4. In your command prompt or terminal window, cd to the directory into which you cloned the repo, and type `git checkout ` followed by pasting in the SHA you just copied, then hit enter.
 5. Voila, you have all of the MusicList code at that exact spot
 6. Congratulations, a winner is you!
